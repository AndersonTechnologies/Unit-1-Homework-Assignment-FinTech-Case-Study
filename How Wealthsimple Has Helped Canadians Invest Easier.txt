James Anderson


## Overview and Origin
* Name of company
Wealthsimple Inc.


* When was the company incorporated?
Founded in September 2014


* Who are the founders of the company?
Michael Katchen is the founder of Wealthsimple


* How did the idea for the company (or project) come about?
Before founding Wealthsimple Michael Katchen worked at a Silicon Valley- based startup startup called 1000Memories, after Ancestry bought out 1000Memories he        created a spreadsheet to help his colleagues set up investment portfolios. When he realized how interested people were in this spreadsheet, he thought a company that would help people invest would be a good idea.


* How is the company funded? How much funding have they received?
In total they have received about $130 million CAD from companies like Technology Crossover ventures, Greylock Partners, Meritech Capital Partners. Two Sigma Ventures, and Allianz X


## Business Activities:


* What specific financial problem is the company or project trying to solve?
To make investing more simple for Canadians 


* Who is the company's intended customer?  Is there any information about the market size of this set of customers?
The intended customer seems to be young adults, the market size for this specific type of customer is very large because people are learning the importance of investing and saving money due to the fact that most jobs don't give you an RESP if they’re no unionized


* What solution does this company offer that their competitors do not or cannot offer? (What is the unfair advantage they utilize?)
They allow investing in crypto through their platform which most mainstream banks have blocked. This is so strong is because the recent crypto boom has a lot of eyes on it and with wealthsimple being one of the few platforms to allow the buying and selling of crypto they have an edge over most platforms that don't allow it 


* Which technologies are they currently using, and how are they implementing them? (This may take a little bit of sleuthing–– you may want to search the company’s engineering blog or use sites like Stackshare to find this information.)


## Landscape:


* What domain of the financial industry is the company in?
Robo-Advisor
* What have been the major trends and innovations of this domain over the last 5-10 years?
I’ve found that a lot of young people don’t want to have to go into a bank to do a lot of their banking, they would much rather do everything online which is where the boom of the robo-advisor has come into play.
* What are the other major companies in this domain?
RBC, CIBC, TD, Venn, Questrade, Quantum AI, Kucoin, Binance, Justwealth, Vanguard, BMO,
## Results


* What has been the business impact of this company so far?


* What are some of the core metrics that companies in this domain use to measure success? How is your company performing, based on these metrics?
The metric to measure a how good a firm is in an environment like this would to be to compare it to either the average return on the market as a whole or even better would be to compare it to similar firms with similar portfolios with an equal amount of risk
* How is your company performing relative to competitors in the same domain?
Wealthsimple has the most AUM currently out of any robo advisor in canada and has an average ROI, compared to the BMO Smartfolio




## Recommendations


* If you were to advise the company, what products or services would you suggest they offer? (This could be something that a competitor offers, or use your imagination!)
I would suggest that they offer a higher risk portfolio for young adults(around 18-25)
* Why do you think that offering this product or service would benefit the company?
This would make their app more appealing to another group of customers 
* What technologies would this additional product or service utilize?
For this aggressive growth portfolio you could incorporate a lot of lower market cap cryptocurrencies or even offer a “day trading” option where a percentage of the portfolio is allocated to a fund used for day trading 
* Why are these technologies appropriate for your solution?
Cryptocurrency is undoubtedly going to be the future of the world, the technology that is within this field is going to be incredibly important for the whole country. From verifiable technology in smart contracts which could be used to do almost anything you can think of from buying a home to processing an insurance claim to making sure that your designer shoes aren’t a replica. Getting into this space early could mean life changing gains for everyone involved.
